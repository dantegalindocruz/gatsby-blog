# Notes for Build a Blog with React and Markdown using Gatsby

So three weeks ago I started my journey into the world of **Gatsby** and **GraphQL** and let's just say it wasn't easy. I read everything from the docs, to the different links that were included in the docs, to the video that I started out watching before I was left scratching my head.

At first when I started out my notes I had a notebook full of them and when I started typing everything out I realized that you all would probably die of boredom before you even got past the 10th page. So the new goal was to use the notes that I took from the video and elaborate on them with the other notes that I had when I felt things were a little vague.

One thing that I did find challenging about writing these notes this time around was trying to create notes that didn't sound like I was copying everything down verbatim. But then again I write what I deem important. But with these notes I was able to build a cute little mini blog that I was proud of and it actually inspired me to work on my own blog which I am currently doing now.

I hope you find these notes to be very useful.
