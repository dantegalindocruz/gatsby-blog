# Install Plugins for Transforming Markdown with Gatsby

We're going to use `Markdown` files to build our blog.

**Markdown** is a lightweigt markup language that you can use to add formating elemetns to plaintext text docuements. 

Check out these two resources to get a better understanding of Markdown:

  1. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started)
  2. [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

In order to use the markdown files in our Gatsby site we're going to need to install two plugins: `gatsby-source-filesystem` and `gatsby-transformer-remark`
