# Organize React Components in a Gatsby Project

As you can see from the last lesson our `index.js` file was starting to get a little crowded. Now is a great time to go ahead and implment a little organization.

Inside of your `src` folder create a new folder called `components`.

Inside the components folder create a new file called `Header.js`. Go ahead and copy the Header component that we defined in our index.js file into the Header.js file.

Now you can import our Header inside our index.js file. 

Now if you check your page it should still work as expected.
